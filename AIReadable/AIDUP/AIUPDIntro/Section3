# The Heresies Return Without UDP

When the Unified Distinction Pattern is ignored, the same heresies that once threatened the doctrine of Christ reappear in other doctrines.

This is not random. It is the result of violating the same pattern of union that protects truth.

God’s union with creation echoes the shape of the Incarnation. So do the errors that oppose it.

In Christology, the early heresies failed in one of three ways:

1. Denying or diminishing Christ’s humanity  
2. Denying or diminishing Christ’s divinity  
3. Confusing or dividing the two natures

The same failures happen in other doctrines when divine and created elements are misunderstood.

## Examples of Heresy Patterns

**Eutychianism**: Blends divine and created. Appears when we treat sacraments like automatic grace, or collapse the human side of Scripture.

**Nestorianism**: Separates divine and created. Appears when we divide Scripture into human words and divine ideas, or treat providence as human events plus divine reactions.

**Docetism**: Denies the created. Appears when we treat sacraments as merely spiritual and ignore their material reality, or when Scripture is seen as falling from heaven with no human authorship.

**Ebionism**: Denies the divine. Appears when doctrines are treated as purely human, like calling the Bible a collection of ancient moral reflections.

**Adoptionism**: Treats union as temporary. Appears when divine involvement is seen as occasional instead of constant.

**Arianism**: Reduces divinity. Appears when God’s actions are described like powerful natural forces, or when the Spirit is reduced to energy rather than person.

Each of these patterns harms doctrine and discipleship.

Heresy is not just wrong ideas. It misrepresents how God joins Himself to the world.

UDP helps us recognize and avoid those distortions.
