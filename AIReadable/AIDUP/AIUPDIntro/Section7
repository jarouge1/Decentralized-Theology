# What UDP Does Not Do

UDP is a powerful tool. But like all tools, it has limits.

## What It Does Not Do

- It does not explain how union works  
- It is not a theory of everything  
- It is not an analogy  
- It does not declare people heretics  
- It does not flatten doctrine differences  
- It does not eliminate mystery

UDP gives us boundaries. It marks what must be preserved and what must be avoided.

It keeps us from drifting too farâ€”without claiming to explain the whole mystery of God.
