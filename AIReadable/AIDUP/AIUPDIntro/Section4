# Applying UDP to Doctrine

If Christ is truly God and truly man in one person, then that union reveals how God interacts with creation.

This is not speculation. It is the logic of Chalcedon applied to other doctrines that serve as bridges between God and creation.

Doctrines like Scripture, baptism, and providence each unite a created reality with divine presence and action.

Each must be affirmed in this structure:

- Fully created  
- Fully divine  
- Truly united

Denying any part leads to theological collapse.

UDP guards against flattening. It does not treat all divine-human interactions as identical. It honors their uniqueness while protecting their structure.

## Example: Scripture

Scripture is not half divine and half human.

Every word is God-breathed. Every sentence was written by a real person in a real culture.

- If we reduce the divine side, Scripture becomes just a human book.  
- If we reduce the human side, it becomes a magical text.  
- If we separate them, we divide the Word of God.  
- If we blend them, we lose human intent and the need for interpretation.

UDP gives us a grammar that keeps all parts intact.

It protects the mystery while affirming the truth.
