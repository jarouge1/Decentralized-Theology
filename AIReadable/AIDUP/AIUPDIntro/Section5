# Using UDP Faithfully

UDP is not only a doctrinal tool. It is a guide for theology, worship, and discipleship.

The greatest danger in misusing UDP is not just intellectual. It is spiritual.

When we distort how God joins with creation, we distort how grace works.

We lose the ability to hear God's Word clearly or to receive His gifts rightly.

## How UDP Shapes Our Life

**In theology**: UDP helps us preserve both the divine and human realities in each doctrine. It avoids blending or division.

**In worship**: UDP reminds us that the visible signs—water, bread, wine—are not mere symbols. They are joined with real divine action.

**In discipleship**: UDP teaches us that God works through created means. His grace is not abstract. It is active in the world.

UDP offers protection from error. It also points the way toward faithful, whole-life engagement with the truth.
