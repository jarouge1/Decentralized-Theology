# Summary and Invitation

UDP is not a new theology. It is a faithful grammar.

It builds on the pattern revealed in Christâ€”fully created, fully divine, truly united.

It helps us speak clearly about how God joins with creation in other doctrines, without falling into confusion, separation, or distortion.

## This Explainer Has Shown:

- Why analogies cannot explain the Incarnation or UDP  
- How Chalcedon protects both clarity and mystery  
- What structure lies at the heart of UDP  
- How that structure applies to other doctrines  
- How UDP guards truth and preserves mystery

Now it is time to go deeper.

Each doctrine that follows will be explored in light of UDP.

Let this pattern guide your study, sharpen your theology, and protect what is holy.
