# The Threefold Structure of UDP

The Unified Distinction Pattern is built on a threefold grammar drawn from the Council of Chalcedon:

1. Fully and distinctly created  
2. Fully and distinctly divine  
3. Truly united without confusion or separation

These three truths must be affirmed together. If any are denied, distorted, or ignored, the pattern breaks and heresy follows.

This is not an abstract formula. It is the actual structure of Christ.

Jesus is not partly God and partly man. He is not a hybrid. He is not two persons. He is one divine person who is fully God and fully human.

This same logic applies to any doctrine where God unites with creation.

Wherever that union occurs, the pattern echoes.

## What Each Part Affirms

**Fully created**: The created element must be real and not symbolic. The Bible was written by human authors. Baptism uses real water. History unfolds with real agency. Creation matters.

**Fully divine**: The divine element must not be reduced. Scripture is the Word of God. Baptism is a means of grace. Providence is God at work, not just random events.

**Real unity**: The divine and created are not placed side by side. They are joined in a real, mysterious union. In Christ, this union is deepest. In other doctrines, the shape is similar, though not identical.

This union cannot be fully explained. But it can be described and preserved.

UDP gives us language that protects the mystery and guards against error.
