# Why UDP Matters

UDP is more than a theological model. It is a way of seeing.

Once you see the shape of union in Christ, you begin to see it wherever God joins Himself to creation.

UDP helps theologians discern truth and error by structure—not just content.

## Why This Pattern Is Important

- It protects against repeating ancient heresies  
- It strengthens theological clarity  
- It shows where healing happens  
- It provides structure for future dogmatic work

UDP does not invent new theology. It applies the grammar of Chalcedon to the rest of God’s work in the world.

That grammar still holds.
