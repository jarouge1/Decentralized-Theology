# AI-Readable: UDPCore Section 1 – The Nature of God

## Major Premise
God always acts in a way consistent with His own unchanging nature.

## Logical Setup
If God is holy, good, just, immutable, and self-consistent,
then every action He takes will reflect those same qualities.

## Theological Logic
God's nature is the foundation for understanding all of His interactions with creation.

## Scriptural Confirmation (Two or Three Witnesses)

### God Does Not Change (Immutability)
- Malachi 3:6
- Hebrews 13:8
- James 1:17

### God Is Holy
- Isaiah 6:3
- Leviticus 19:2
- 1 Peter 1:15–16

### God Is Good
- Psalm 107:1
- Psalm 34:8
- Nahum 1:7

### God Is Just and Lawful
- Deuteronomy 32:4
- Isaiah 30:18
- Psalm 89:14

### God Is Self-Consistent
- 1 John 1:5
- 2 Timothy 2:13
- Numbers 23:19

### God Always Acts According to His Nature
- Psalm 33:11
- Hebrews 6:17–18
- Deuteronomy 7:9

## Theological Method Used
Truth is established by multiple witnesses (Deut. 19:15, Matt. 18:16, 2 Cor. 13:1). 
This method is used to confirm each divine attribute.

## Summary Conclusion
A God who is holy, good, just, immutable, and self-consistent
must act in ways that are ordered, coherent, and faithful to His own being.
This is the foundation of theological logic and the first step of the Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP).

## Logical Status
This section establishes the major premise of the full argument for UDP.
Next: Creation reflects the divine nature by following the same coherent structure.
