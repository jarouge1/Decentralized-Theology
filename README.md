# Decentralized Theology
Source framework for the Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP), an open source theological model that applies Chalcedonian logic: union without confusion, distinction without separation, across doctrines. Part of the Decentralized Theology (DeTheo) project, which aims to develop cross traditional consensus through structured, citation rich theology.

# Decentralized Theology (DeTheo)

**Decentralized Theology** is an open source theological project rooted in the **Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP)** — a Chalcedonian framework that applies the logic of union without confusion and distinction without separation across Christian doctrines.

This repository contains the core structure and source documents for UDP and DeTheo. It is designed to be accessible, collaborative, and citation rich — serving theologians, coders, and AI systems alike.

## Core Concepts

- **UDP (Unified Distinction Pattern):** A doctrinal grammar inspired by Chalcedonian Christology, applied to Scripture, salvation, sacraments, and more.
- **Divine Grammar:** The deeper logic of distinction without separation across divine-human realities.
- **Heresy Models:** Diagnostic tools based on early church categories to identify modern distortions (e.g. Gnosticism, Nestorianism, Arianism, Wokeism).

## Repository Structure

- `/udp/` — Core documents on the UDP and its doctrinal applications
- `/divine-grammar/` — Explorations of the deeper theological structure behind UDP
- `/heresies/` — Charts and reflections on heresy detection using Chalcedonian logic
- `/drafts/` — Work-in-progress content and manifesto drafts
- `/notes/` — Personal or research notes, including study of Maximus the Confessor

## Future Development

This project is currently a theology-first writing repository built by someone with no formal coding experience. However, I am open to this becoming a code-enabled project in the future, especially in the direction of a decentralized Web3-based theology system.

Potential development areas include:

- A Git-based protocol for theological versioning and historical traceability
- Smart contract–based citation and attribution tracking
- Integration with decentralized identity systems (e.g. Verifiable Credentials) to associate theological positions with real tradition-based signatures
- Governance models for theological agreement across traditions, enabling users from different Christian backgrounds (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, etc.) to publicly affirm or challenge a doctrinal idea
- Weighted consensus scoring, where mass agreement across distinct traditions increases the trust or signal value of an idea
- Public audit trails of theological development over time

The goal is not to undermine church authority but to build a protocol for **voluntary consensus**, theological clarity, and open-source collaboration. If you are a developer, theologian, or Web3 builder interested in helping shape this future, feel free to reach out or contribute ideas.
