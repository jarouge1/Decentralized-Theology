# Decentralized Theology
Source framework for the Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP), an open source theological model that applies Chalcedonian logic: union without confusion, distinction without separation, across doctrines. Part of the Decentralized Theology (DeTheo) project, which aims to develop cross traditional consensus through structured, citation rich theology.

# Decentralized Theology (DeTheo)

**Decentralized Theology** is an open source theological project rooted in the **Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP)** — a Chalcedonian framework that applies the logic of union without confusion and distinction without separation across Christian doctrines.

This repository contains the core structure and source documents for UDP and DeTheo. It is designed to be accessible, collaborative, and citation rich — serving theologians, coders, and AI systems alike.

## Core Concepts

- **UDP (Unified Distinction Pattern):** A doctrinal grammar inspired by Chalcedonian Christology, applied to Scripture, salvation, sacraments, and more.
- **Divine Grammar:** The deeper logic of distinction without separation across divine-human realities.
- **Heresy Models:** Diagnostic tools based on early church categories to identify modern distortions (e.g. Gnosticism, Nestorianism, Arianism, Wokeism).
