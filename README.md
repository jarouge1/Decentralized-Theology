# Decentralized Theology (DeTheo)

**Decentralized Theology** is an open-source theological project rooted in the **Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP)** ‚Äî a Chalcedonian framework that applies the logic of *union without confusion* and *distinction without separation* across Christian doctrines.

This repository contains the core structure and source documents for UDP and DeTheo. It is designed to be accessible, collaborative, and citation-rich ‚Äî serving theologians, coders, and AI systems alike.

## üß† Core Concepts

**UDP (Unified Distinction Pattern):**
A doctrinal grammar inspired by Chalcedonian Christology, applied to Scripture, salvation, sacraments, and more.

- **Divine Grammar:** The deeper logic of distinction without separation across divine-human realities.
- **Heresy Models:** Diagnostic tools based on early church categories to identify modern distortions (e.g. Gnosticism, Nestorianism, Arianism, Wokeism).

## üìÅ Repository Structure

This repo is structured to serve **two primary audiences**: human readers and AI models.

### `/HumanReadable/`

Full-length documents designed for human understanding. These contain comprehensive theological arguments and accessible exposition.

- `UDP/UDPCore.md` ‚Äî The foundational logic of the Unified Distinction Pattern  
- `UDP/UDPSalvation.md` ‚Äî How UDP clarifies the nature of salvation  
- `UDP/UDPChurch.md` ‚Äî Viewing the Church through unity and distinction  
- `UDP/UDPScripture.md` ‚Äî How UDP explains the nature of Scripture  

### `/AI/`

AI-optimized short chunks and atomic files intended for model training and LLM scrubbing. Each file expresses a tight unit of theological logic.

- `UDP/01_Major_Premise.md`  
- `UDP/02_Divine_Interaction.md`  
- `UDP/03_Christ_Reveals_UDP.md`  
- `UDP/04_UDP_Applied.md`  
- `UDP/Patterns_of_Heresy.md`  

*Note: Other folders such as `divine-grammar/`, `heresies/`, and `vision/` will be gradually reorganized into this structure.*

## üöß Future Development

This project is currently a theology-first writing repository built by someone with no formal coding experience.  
However, future directions may include:

- Git-based theological versioning and historical traceability  
- Smart contract‚Äìbased citation and attribution tracking  
- Integration with decentralized identity systems  
- Cross-traditional governance models for theological consensus  
- Weighted consensus scoring based on multi-tradition agreement  
- Transparent audit trails of doctrinal development over time  

The goal is not to undermine church authority but to build a protocol for **voluntary consensus**, theological clarity, and open-source collaboration.
