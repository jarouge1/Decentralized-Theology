# Preface: The Structure of the Argument

This document presents a step-by-step theological argument grounded in the nature of God and culminating in what we call the **Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP)**. 

**Definition:** The Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP) is a theological principle that describes how God relates to creation through a structure of *unity without confusion* and *distinction without separation*.

The goal is to show that God's consistent character results in a consistent pattern in how He interacts with creation, especially as revealed in the incarnation of Christ.

The structure of this argument follows four main steps:

1. **Major Premise:** God always acts in a way consistent with His own unchanging nature.

2. **Derived Principle:** Because God always acts according to His nature, all of His interactions with creation must reflect the integrity of that nature. This includes creation itself, covenant, revelation, and redemption.

3. **Christological Example:** In Jesus Christ, we see the clearest expression of this divine interaction: full divinity and full humanity united in one person, without confusion or separation. This is the definition affirmed at the Council of Chalcedon (AD 451).

4. **Universal Application:** This pattern of unity without confusion and distinction without separation is not limited to Christ. It reveals how God consistently works in all areas of theology, including Scripture, sacraments, salvation, and the church. We call this the Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP).

Each section of this document corresponds to one of these four steps. What follows is Section 1, which establishes the major premise.

# Section 1: The Nature of God – The Foundation of Theological Logic

### **Major Premise: God always acts in a way consistent with His own unchanging nature.**

Before we can speak about how God relates to creation, we must first ask: What kind of God is He? All theology depends on this answer.

The God of the Bible is not like the gods of Babylon, Egypt, or Greece. Ancient pagans imagined their deities as powerful but unstable, subject to passions, divided against one another, and often indifferent to moral order. These gods could lie, rage, change, and contradict themselves. There was no reliable logic in their character and no consistent structure in how they related to the world.

The God of Scripture is holy, faithful, and unchanging. He does not lie. He does not shift. He does not violate His own nature. He is, always and perfectly, who He is.

This has consequences. A God who is eternally consistent with Himself will never act in a way that contradicts His being. Everything He creates and everything He does reflects His character. Divine action is not chaotic, random, or contradictory. It is ordered, holy, and internally coherent. This is the foundation for theological logic.

# Theological Method: “Two or Three Witnesses”

Scriptural truth is not established by isolated proof texts. The biblical standard is to confirm every matter by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

**Deuteronomy 19:15**  
"A single witness shall not suffice against a person for any crime or for any wrong... Only on the evidence of two witnesses or of three witnesses shall a charge be established."

**Matthew 18:16**  
"But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses."

**2 Corinthians 13:1**  
"Every charge must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses."

This principle does not only apply to discipline or law. It is a pattern of confirmation built into God’s Word. Therefore, when identifying doctrinal truth, we will look for at least two or three passages that affirm a given attribute or pattern. This safeguards against distortion and ensures we are drawing from the fullness of Scripture.

# Attributes of God's Nature

### 1. **God Does Not Change (Immutability)**

**Malachi 3:6**  
"I the Lord do not change. Therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed."

**Hebrews 13:8**  
"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever."

**James 1:17**  
"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change."

God does not evolve, regress, shift in temperament, or contradict Himself. His character is eternally stable.

---

### 2. **God Is Holy**

**Isaiah 6:3**  
"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full of His glory."

**Leviticus 19:2**  
"You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy."

**1 Peter 1:15–16**  
"But as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'"

Holiness is not merely one attribute among many. It is the sum of all His perfections expressed as moral purity, separateness from corruption, and the blazing integrity of His being.

---

### 3. **God Is Good**

**Psalm 107:1**  
"Oh give thanks to the Lord, for He is good, for His steadfast love endures forever."

**Psalm 34:8**  
"Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good. Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him."

**Nahum 1:7**  
"The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble. He knows those who take refuge in Him."

God’s actions are not only powerful. They are righteous and kind. His goodness is not arbitrary. It flows from His unchanging nature.

---

### 4. **God Is Just and Lawful**

**Deuteronomy 32:4**  
"The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are justice. A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is He."

**Isaiah 30:18**  
"For the Lord is a God of justice. Blessed are all those who wait for Him."

**Psalm 89:14**  
"Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne. Steadfast love and faithfulness go before You."

God is not merely a moral example. He is the source of law, the measure of justice, and the one whose judgments are always right.

---

### 5. **God Is Self-Consistent**

**1 John 1:5**  
"God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all."

**2 Timothy 2:13**  
"If we are faithless, He remains faithful. For He cannot deny Himself."

**Numbers 23:19**  
"God is not man, that He should lie, or a son of man, that He should change His mind. Has He said, and will He not do it?"

God’s will, words, and actions are never at odds with His essence. He does not self-contradict. He is never hypocritical or deceptive.

---

### 6. **God Always Acts According to His Nature**

**Psalm 33:11**  
"The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of His heart to all generations."

**Hebrews 6:17–18**  
"So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of His purpose, He guaranteed it with an oath, so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement..."

**Deuteronomy 7:9**  
"Know therefore that the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love Him and keep His commandments, to a thousand generations."

God never acts contrary to His character. What He does always reflects who He is. His plans, judgments, promises, and relationships all flow from the integrity of His nature.

# Conclusion: Theological Pattern Requires a Faithful God

If God is always true to Himself, then His actions are not random or contradictory. They are stable, reliable, and structured. The way He interacts with creation must reflect the internal coherence of His being.

Theology is not built on invention. It is built on the observable regularity of a God who is holy, just, good, and unchanging. Without this, there would be no foundation for doctrinal clarity. With it, we can begin to trace how God’s nature is revealed not only in His commands, but also in the very structure of His relationship with the world.

## Stated Major Premise

**God always acts in a way consistent with His own unchanging nature.**

In the next section, we will explore what this means for how God interacts with creation, and how the incarnation of Christ reveals the clearest expression of this divine logic.
