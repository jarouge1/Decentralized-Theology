# UDP and Salvation

This document will explore how the Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP) applies to the doctrine of salvation.

Just as Christ is fully divine and fully human—united without confusion, distinct without separation—so too salvation reflects a union of divine initiative and human response. The Chalcedonian logic protects both the sovereignty of God and the responsibility of humanity without collapsing into determinism or Pelagianism.

## Core Claim

Salvation is best understood through the logic revealed in Christ. It is:

- Fully a work of God, fully involving the human person
- United without confusion (not semi-Pelagian blending)
- Distinct without separation (not Calvinist-style monergism that erases response)

The same divine-human grammar that defines Christ also structures how salvation operates. Any model that divides grace from faith, or collapses one into the other, risks falling into a theological heresy parallel to Nestorianism or Eutychianism.

## Areas for Development

- Scriptural basis (e.g. Philippians 2:12–13, Ephesians 2:8–9, John 6:44)
- Historical debates (Pelagius, Augustine, Reformers, Arminius)
- Heresy mapping: how salvation errors mirror Christological errors
- Unity of justification and sanctification in a single divine-human process
