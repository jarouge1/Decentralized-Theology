# UDP and Scripture

This document will explore how the Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP) applies to the doctrine of Scripture.

Just as Christ is fully divine and fully human—united without confusion, distinct without separation—so too Scripture is both fully the Word of God and fully written by human authors. The pattern revealed in Christ serves as the blueprint for understanding how divine and human elements can coexist in a single unified expression.

## Core Claim

Scripture is best understood through Chalcedonian logic. It is:

- Fully divine and fully human
- United without confusion
- Distinct without separation

This avoids collapsing into mechanical dictation (denying humanity) or pure literary artifact (denying divinity).

## Areas for Development

- Scriptural support for dual authorship (e.g. 2 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1:21)
- Church tradition on the nature of Scripture
- Application of Christological heresies to Scripture misreadings
- Comparison to Islamic or Gnostic views of revelation
