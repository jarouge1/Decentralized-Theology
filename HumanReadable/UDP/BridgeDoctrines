# What Is a Bridge Doctrine?

## 1. Introduction: The Category We Need

Some doctrines are different from others. They do not just teach about God or creation. They unite them. These doctrines are structured like Christ Himself: 100 percent divine, 100 percent created, one unified thing. They do not confuse the categories or hold them apart. They hold both together. These are what we call **bridge doctrines**.

We need a name for this category because the Unified Distinction Pattern only applies to it. The pattern reflects the structure of Christ's own nature: fully God, fully man, one unified person. Not every doctrine shares that structure. Defining this category clearly allows us to apply the pattern where it belongs and nowhere else.

These are what we call **bridge doctrines**, doctrines in which something fully divine and something fully created are joined together in one unified act. More precisely, they are examples of what we call **dependent union doctrines**. That is, their union depends entirely on the prior reality of Christ’s hypostatic union. Without the Incarnation, these doctrines could not exist. We use the term “bridge” for simplicity and clarity, but the technical term helps capture what makes them possible and how they are structured.

## 2. What Makes a Doctrine a Bridge Doctrine

A bridge doctrine is a doctrine in which something 100 percent divine and something 100 percent created are joined together in one unified thing. This dependent union must preserve the full integrity of both elements. It must be grounded in the work of Christ, and it must follow the same logical structure revealed in the Incarnation.

We call this a dependent union because it exists only through Christ's unique hypostatic union. Without the Incarnation, there would be no pattern or possibility for God to unite Himself to creation in this way. This dependent union is not the hypostatic union itself. Only Christ unites divine and human natures in one person. Bridge doctrines involve divine action and created reality joined in one unified thing. They follow the same Chalcedonian structure but remain ontologically distinct from Christ's person.

These doctrines are not analogies. They are actual places where God unites Himself to creation through the Spirit of Christ. Each one reflects the same four-part structure: full divinity, full createdness, genuine union, and a Chalcedonian logic that keeps the natures distinct and the whole unified.

## 3. The Role of Christ and His Spirit

All true bridge doctrines exist because of Christ. Without the Incarnation, there would be no pattern of divine-creation union. And without His resurrection and ascension, there would be no ongoing reality in which that union is extended to us.

But this union does not happen automatically. It is made present by the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit takes what belongs to Christ and brings it into genuine contact with created reality. This is why bridge doctrines are not just about God doing something. They are about Christ sharing something. They are fully divine, fully created, and joined in one unified act.

## 4. Examples of Valid Bridge Doctrines

This is not a comprehensive list. Other doctrines may meet the criteria for divine-creation union. But the following three are clear examples that meet all four criteria. In each case, something 100 percent created is united with something 100 percent divine to form one unified thing. These doctrines reflect the pattern revealed in Christ and are possible only through His person and work.

### Scripture

Scripture is 100 percent human words and 100 percent the Word of God. It is not a mixture or alternation. The divine and the human are fully present at the same time in one unified text. The Bible does not shift between being God's Word and man's word. It is both at once, joined without confusion or separation. The Spirit of Christ speaks through fully human authors and unites both realities.

### Baptism

Baptism is 100 percent created water and 100 percent a divine act of grace. The water is fully physical. The grace is fully divine. Yet the two are joined in one unified action given by Christ and made effective by His Spirit. This union does not blur the physical and the spiritual. It holds them together in the same structure revealed in Christ's own baptism, where heaven and earth are joined without collapse.

### The Gospel Call

The proclamation of the gospel is 100 percent human speech and 100 percent the divine call of God. It is not two separate calls. It is one unified voice in which God uses created words to accomplish His saving purpose. The preacher speaks, and God speaks through him. The created and the divine are both fully present, joined in a unified act that brings new life by the Spirit of Christ.

Each of these examples involves a genuine union, preserves the full integrity of both elements, is rooted in Christ, and follows the grammar of Chalcedon. They are not metaphors or illustrations. They are structured realities where God unites Himself to creation in the same pattern revealed in Christ. Each one is 100 percent divine, 100 percent created, and one unified thing.

## 5. What Is Not a Bridge Doctrine and Why

Many doctrines are only about God or only about creation. They may be true and important, but they do not involve a union between something 100 percent divine and something 100 percent created. In a bridge doctrine, both must be fully present and truly joined together in one unified thing. Without that kind of union, the structure of the Unified Distinction Pattern does not apply.

### The Attributes of God

Doctrines like omniscience, omnipotence, and eternality describe who God is in Himself. These are 100 percent divine, but they do not involve any created element. There is no union taking place. These doctrines do not form a bridge.

### Angelology and Other Created Doctrines

Teachings about angels, nature, or human reason are 100 percent created realities. They may describe how created beings relate to God, but they do not involve God uniting Himself to those created things in a structured way. There is no unified thing that is both divine and created.

### The Doctrine of Divine Simplicity

This doctrine teaches that God is not made of parts and that His attributes are identical with His essence. It is 100 percent divine. There is no created component, no participation, and no joining of divine and created elements. It describes God in Himself, not God in union with the world. There is no single thing that is both divine and created.

Bridge doctrines must involve something 100 percent divine and something 100 percent created, joined together as one unified thing. If a doctrine lacks that kind of union, it falls outside the scope of the Unified Distinction Pattern.

## 6. Why Defining Bridge Doctrines Matters

The Unified Distinction Pattern only applies to doctrines that involve a union between something 100 percent divine and something 100 percent created, joined together in one unified thing. If we do not define that category carefully, we risk applying the pattern too broadly or loosely. That would weaken the clarity the pattern is meant to provide.

Not every doctrine includes this kind of union. Many doctrines describe either divine truths or created realities without joining the two in one structured whole. Bridge doctrines are unique because they follow the same pattern revealed in Christ and extended by His Spirit.

By identifying these doctrines clearly, we protect both the pattern and the mystery it guards. We do not apply it to everything. We apply it only where Christ has truly formed a union between heaven and earth.

Clarity here also allows us to build stronger doctrinal arguments. When we show that a doctrine meets the full criteria—100 percent divine, 100 percent created, one unified thing—we can apply the pattern with confidence. This protects us from collapsing categories, confusing natures, or forcing analogies that do not hold. It also helps us recognize where genuine theological power is at work.
