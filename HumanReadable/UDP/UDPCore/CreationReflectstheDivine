# The Unified Distinction Pattern: A Theological Syllogism

This document outlines a four-step theological argument, building toward what we call the **Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP)**. Each section corresponds to one of the following four steps:

1. **God always acts in a way consistent with His own unchanging nature.**  
2. **Therefore, all His interactions with the world reflect His nature.**  
3. **In Jesus Christ, we see the clearest expression of this divine interaction:** full divinity and full humanity united in one person, without confusion or separation. This is the definition affirmed at the Council of Chalcedon (AD 451).  
4. **This pattern of unity without confusion and distinction without separation is not limited to Christ.** It reveals how God consistently works in all areas of theology, including Scripture, sacraments, salvation, and the church. We call this the **Unified Distinction Pattern (UDP).**

Each section of this document unpacks one of these four claims.

## Section 2: Therefore, Everything God Does in Relation to the World Reflects His Unchanging Nature

If God always acts in line with His eternal character, then His works in history will consistently bear the mark of who He is. His actions are never arbitrary or out of sync with His being. They are faithful expressions of His power, wisdom, justice, mercy, and truth.

To demonstrate this, we will look at several key areas of theology. This is not a comprehensive list, but it is enough to show the consistent pattern: **God always acts according to who He is.**

### 1. God Creates According to His Power, Wisdom, and Goodness

God's act of creation is not separate from His nature. What He made reflects who He is: eternal, wise, powerful, and good.

> **Romans 1:20**  
> "For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse."

> **Psalm 33:11**  
> "The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of his heart to all generations."

> **James 1:17**  
> "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change."

### 2. God Establishes Covenants According to His Faithfulness and Mercy

God does not enter covenants out of impulse or changing emotion. He binds Himself to His people because He is faithful and merciful by nature.

> **Malachi 3:6**  
> "For I the Lord do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed."

> **Deuteronomy 7:9**  
> "Know therefore that the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations."

> **Psalm 89:34**  
> "I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips."

### 3. God Speaks Through Scripture According to His Truthfulness and Faithfulness

God reveals Himself because He is true. His written Word is trustworthy and enduring because it flows from His unchanging nature. Scripture is not just inspired content—it is consistent with the character of its Author.

> **Titus 1:2**  
> "In hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began."

> **Psalm 119:89–90**  
> "Forever, O Lord, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens. Your faithfulness endures to all generations."

> **Isaiah 40:8**  
> "The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever."

### 4. God Redeems According to His Justice and Love

Redemption is not a break in God’s character. It is the clearest display of it. The cross shows a God who is just and merciful in perfect unity.

> **Isaiah 30:18**  
> "Therefore the Lord waits to be gracious to you, and therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you. For the Lord is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him."

> **Romans 3:25–26**  
> "God put [Christ] forward as a propitiation by his blood… to show God’s righteousness… so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus."

> **Isaiah 54:8**  
> "In overflowing anger for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you, says the Lord, your Redeemer."

---

### 5. God Gives Sacraments According to His Grace and Covenant Presence

God does not give signs and sacraments as empty rituals. They are expressions of His consistent, gracious desire to dwell with and nourish His people.

> **Exodus 29:45–46**  
> "I will dwell among the people of Israel and will be their God. And they shall know that I am the Lord their God..."

> **Matthew 28:19–20**  
> "Go therefore and make disciples… baptizing them… teaching them… and behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."

> **1 Corinthians 11:25–26**  
> "This cup is the new covenant in my blood… For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."

### 6. God Forms the Church According to His Holiness, Unity, and Eternal Purpose

The Church is not just a saved group of individuals. It is a people set apart by God, shaped by His character, and gathered according to His eternal will. God is holy, so He calls His people to be holy. God is one, so He calls His people to be united. God is love, so He forms a community marked by love. The very existence of the Church reveals the nature of the One who formed it.

> **Ephesians 1:4–5**  
> "Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will."

> **1 Peter 1:15–16**  
> "But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy."

> **John 17:22–23**  
> "The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one… so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me."

## Conclusion to Section 2

From creation to covenant, from redemption to the church, God acts in time according to who He is in eternity. His unchanging nature is not hidden behind His works. It shines through them. Every divine interaction is consistent because God is consistent.

That is why we can say with confidence:

> **Everything God does in relation to the world reflects His unchanging nature.**

## Next Section Preview

In Section 3, we will examine the clearest and most concentrated expression of God's interaction with the world: the person of Jesus Christ. According to the Council of Chalcedon (AD 451), Christ is fully God and fully man, united in one person without confusion or separation.

This is not a random exception to how God works. It is the ultimate revelation of how God always works. In Christ, the eternal nature of God is made visible in time, and the pattern of divine interaction reaches its high point.

**Section 3 will show how the Incarnation confirms and embodies the principle that God always acts in a way consistent with His own nature.**
